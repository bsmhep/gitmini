# GitMini

This is a portable mini command with very limited git functionalities.
It is written in [go](https://golang.org/)
and using [go-git](https://github.com/src-d/go-git).
The usage is mostly compatible with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and should be used
only in [BSM](https://github.com/bsmsoft/bsm).
